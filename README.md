**Tic Tac Toe.**

**Description:**<br />
  A simple tic tac toe game which can track userâ€™s stats.<br />
  Users sign in with their account to play. Their game is saved to an API (set up by General Assembly). They can later retrieve stats (# of games played, finished, and won).

**Development process and problem-solving strategies:**<br />
  Started with wireframe and basic html structure. The cornerstones of this design are the jquery .show() and .hide() methods. This allows for a single page application.<br />
  I started with basic game functionality then worked on the ajax calls for login, then for updating and retrieving game information from the server. I tested new functionality every step of the way and regularly ran smoke tests to make sure I didn't break any existing functionality.<br />
  My strategy mostly involves segmenting features or issues into small tasks, and handling only one problem at a time. It's tempting to get distracted by something else that needs fixing, but I try put those issues on a to-do list to tackle at another time.<br />
  Once the "wiring" was all hooked up. I worked on hiding and showing sections of the page based on where the user was in the process. (For example: log in fields should be hidden if the user is already logged in)<br />
  Finally, when everything was tested and functioning properly, styling was added as a finishing touch.<br />
  Followed by another round of testing for good measure.<br />

**Future Improvements/Enhancements**<br />
  Refactor JS code to use classes for click handlers instead of ID's<br />
  remove code that was commented out<br />
  add comments for clarity<br />
  *Potential Enhancement:* Give users links to sites with history of Tic-Tac-Toe, strategy, etc.<br />
